# Witness Statement: Karen Walters
**Date:** October 14, 2023

> **Testimony Excerpt**:
> 
> “I was in the lobby waiting to file some paperwork. Around 9:00 AM, I noticed a man pacing near the reception desk. He was wearing a gray hoodie, jeans, and had a tattoo on his left arm. He kept checking his phone and appeared nervous. I briefly saw him place a black bag under a seat near the entrance. Then he quickly walked out.
> 
> I alerted the security guard, John Scott, but before he could approach, we heard a loud bang. The windows shattered, and everyone started screaming. I ran to the side entrance for safety.
> 
> I didn’t recognize the man, but he seemed to be in his late 20s or early 30s. If I saw him again, I might be able to identify him.”
