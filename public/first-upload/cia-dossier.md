## Subject
Mohammed al-Qahtani – Attempted Entry into the United States

## Summary
This dossier documents the case of Mohammed al-Qahtani, who attempted to enter the United States several weeks before the September 11 attacks. The individual, carrying $2,800 in cash and traveling on a one-way ticket, aroused suspicion at the point of entry. Subsequent fingerprint analysis revealed a match with an existing record in the intelligence database, prompting further investigation.

## Key Findings
- **Travel Details:** Al-Qahtani’s itinerary and travel documents indicate irregular patterns, including a last-minute flight booking and unexplained cash holdings.
- **Behavioral Indicators:** The subject’s demeanor and travel behavior were flagged by customs agents, leading to a denial of entry.
- **Connection to 9/11 Network:** Later analysis suggested that al-Qahtani may have been scheduled to meet with Mohamed Atta, as corroborated by additional surveillance at Orlando Airport.

## Action Items
- Reopen case file and cross-reference with known al-Qaeda operatives.
- Increase scrutiny on similar entry attempts and update border screening protocols.
- Monitor any future travel patterns matching this profile.
