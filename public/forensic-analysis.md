# Forensic Analysis of Improvised Explosive Device (IED)
**Date:** October 15, 2023  
**Lab Technician:** Dr. Andrew Patel

## Findings
- **Explosive Material**: Preliminary tests indicate an ammonium nitrate-based compound mixed with fuel oil (ANFO).  
- **Device Construction**: Metal pipe container, digital timer mechanism (likely set for a 30-minute delay).  
- **Evidence Collected**:
  1. Metal Shrapnel Fragments (4 pieces)  
  2. Circuit Board Components with partial serial number #CB-9782  
  3. Black Duffel Bag Remnants (charred canvas, brand unidentified)

- **Fingerprint Analysis**: Two partial prints recovered on the pipe fragments. No immediate match in the local database.

## Additional Notes
- This type of IED construction is consistent with prior incidents in neighboring counties, particularly referencing a case from 2018 in Pineville involving a similar homemade device.  
- The possibility of an extremist group cannot be ruled out given the political note found at the scene.
